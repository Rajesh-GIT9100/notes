1. Linux, bash and git commands
2. ⁠networking concepts 
3. ⁠stick with one cloud Aws, azure or GCP 
4. ⁠devops tools start with docker cicd 
5. ⁠terraform infra 
6. ⁠deployments using kubernets clusters 
7. ⁠tools ansible

Day 0 - Summary
Day 1 - public cloud
Day 2 - AIM ,users,groups,permissions  -Practical root ,AIM user

Day 3 - EC2 types what ,why ?  types.1.general 2.compute optimized 3.memory optimized 4.storage optimized 5.accelerated
        Region and availability.

        created instance ,login through terminal or putty ,intall jdk and jenkins
Day 4 - VPC -virtual private cloud
        internet gateway ,public subnet,load balancer->route table  to private subnet or application.
        NAT gateway - masking of public IP addresses.
        VPC flowlogs -to count the traffic

       link - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-example-private-subnets-nat.html

Day 5 - AWS Security using Security Groups(SG) and NACL
         SG -types -inbound traffic n outbound traffic
         Network Access Control List NACL - an extra layer of SG 
         SG - allow access permissions
         NACL -both allow and deny permissions
   >Practical understandings
    ---------------------------------------------
    internet gateway -->NACL-->Sec grps-->EC2 app
    ----------------------------------------------
                      VPC
     ---------------------------------------------

Day 6 - Route 53  DNS - Domain name system
        Domain registration,hosted zones,health checks.

       dns names - amazon.com,flipkart.com,google.com

Day 7 - PROJECT
      auto scaling,load balancer, target group,bastion host or jump server

   --> created auto scaling groups -prerequisite (launch template for autoscale -easy)

       verified  -instances are  created according desired number of created template(but there is no public ip for instances)
       
       { bastion host--> mediator that connects public subnets to private servers.
         Bastion is nothing but launching an ec2 with the public IP and created within the VPC network surrond. } ,deploying small app in to desired ec2

       creating load balancer ....and through the generated dns accessing the ec2 server .

Day 8 - Interview Questions
        GIT reference  

Day 9 - s3 simple storage service , bucket permissions-policies-versioning-static website host

Day 10 -AWS CLI- cmd line interface
        install (oracle virtual box) ,GIT BASh,aws msi
       configured with aws configure with access key ,secret access key,zone ,json format.
      -- read aws documentation

Day 11 - aws CFT -cloud formation templates .
        - Iac infrastructure as Code
        - components,features ,trips and tricks.

        - Terraform -used to handle multi environment of cloud like hybrid ,companies who use both azure and aws
        -CLI used for short and quick works on aws
        -CFT used for huge tags ,three Ec2 resources ,VPC+RT+LB+Ec2
        -detect drift - detects the changes did by users
    --refer aws Documentation for CFT 
    --cft,stacks ,create stacks.
   my understanding of CFT - using a template(YAML or json) creating the services that we need .

Day 12 - AWS CodeCommmit 
        check class for overview code pipeline,code build,code deploy 

        GitHub for hosting the code
        Jenkins for pipeline
        Docker for Build ,Maven for java application or SonarQube
        ansible for deploying 

Day 13 -AWS Code Pipeline | Jenkins vs AWS Code Pipeline | Open Source vs AWS Managed



\\{ Day 19 devops-zero-to-hero course , JDK |JENKINS | DOCKER installation 
       Refer ReadMe file 
       GIT interview questions and other topics such as small projects and notes  }//

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogrx8G8pClQ



Day 14 - AWS END TO END CI | REALTIME PROJECT | DEMO WITH NOTES

        Build--adding GIT path ,environment setup, build specification in aws
       
        AWS-code build using build specs, AWS-CodePipeline (using GIT and AWS Build)
        The aws code pipeline triggers the source(GIT) automatically whenever there is change in source code.


Day 15 - CICD -code deploy-createapllication-ec2 lamda ecs
         aws codedeploy user guide doc and run commands

Day 16 -AWS Cloud Watch -monitoring-alarm-reporting-logging
        Metrics 
        Alarms 
        Custom metrics
                       Demo 1 -create alarm - alert/alarm on CPU utilization 

Day 17- AWS Lambda
        serverless - 1.cost estimation 2.security/complaince
        diff bw ec2 and lambda
        eg : pics upload to cloud ,ETL-export transform load 

Day 18- AWS Cost Optimizaton
        ec2-volumes-snapshot
        1.When we create ec2 automatically volumes are formed for that ec2 ,and snapshots are created by users.
        2.When we delete ec2 automatically volumes are deleted , but the snapshots are not deleted automatically ,which will increase the cost
          (in order to eliminate this scenario ,we use lambda functions to delete the snapshots if its has not used for long time 
            or 
           we can set alarms using cloudwatch.)

Day 19 -Cloud Front -CDN Content delivery network  ,REFER GIT LINK
        provides solution for CDN
        eg : Instagram,central storage system, routers, Latency(loading n reach time)
             latency -time taken to reach/load/communicate (from data request to server )
             CDN copies image/data in local edges by taking from the central system.

        youtube ref :Tech Tutorials with Piyush

        demo : create distributions 

       cloud front forms the copy of s3 bucket across various locations in the world called local edges
       so with the domain name with different location people can easily access the application with less latency.  

Day 20 -AWS ECR , REFER GIT LINK
    elastic container register
    
Day 21 - AWS ECS - Elastic Container Service | create Cluster | cost eefecetive(low)
Day 22 - project on EKS | Refer Git | To Do Things
Day 23 - secret management on AWS | for storing sensitive information
         --Systems Manager (on AWS) - parameter store
         --Secrets Manager (on AWS) - Rotate certificate for mentioned time interval (90days),i.e.,changes the key of password by SM itself after the interval. 
         --Hashicorp vault (outsource solution) - centralised solution can be commonly used for all clouds(aws,azure.etc.)

Day 24 - RTE/project using TERRAFORM -To DO Things
       internet gateway|loadbalancer|subnets|vpc|ec2|S3Bucket

Day 25 - AWS config topic | organization follows set of rules for services |using configs(basic,lambda) these are maintained complaint .

Day 26 - AWS Lad balancers |ALB NLB GWLB | application LB, networking LB, GateWay LB |

   ALB -High cost ,low latency ,works on layer 7 application layer | http request
   NLB -Low cost ,high latency , works on layer 4 network layer | TCP n UDP request
   GWLB - Virtual application ,VPN ,fireWall
         Round robin LB Technique
         NGINX LB
         F5 LB
         ENROY LB
